Within the Solar System, it is third closest to the Sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.[7] Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere."

Besides, I’ve also served NCBA as visiting faculty member, from where I learned to manage human growth and learning. With these two professional experiences going along, I developed the skill to help people learn better and grow more in their careers. Over these years, I’ve always encouraged myself to help employees discover their talent and excel in their careers within the company’s premises. My focus has always been to make sure that I could add value to the professional growth of employees with training and practice facilities. That also made me acquire more knowledge about every aspect that can help human assets to unleash their potential to its fullest because I believe that effective communication can engage employees to their objectives more than anything else. My areas of interest include; 1. Leadership & Navigation. 2. Analytical Evaluation. 3. Performance acknowledgment. 4. Employee training and discussions. 5. Endorse employees’ growth and learning. 6. Talent acquisition. 7. Organizational development. 8. Employee engagement. Being an HR professional, I’m always available for discussions and training that can help employees to make leaps in their profession."

I explore and experiment with my skills and qualities and strive to learn something new every time I get an opportunity. Each new experience for me is a lesson and a chance to enhance my skills and abilities I take pride in my leadership, communication and analytical skills, strong-commitment, detail- oriented nature and performance driven approach. Having interned in the HR Department of two highly reputed organizations, PTCL and OGDCL and as a Recruitment Executive with Career Pakistan, enhanced my work ethic and gave me practical exposure to different functions of HR. The positive contributions I made in streams of research, planning, record-keeping, screening and successful recruitments have built my confidence in being a resolute and thorough HR professional. The gained theoretical business knowledge, hands-on experience and success demonstrated in all streams of work mentioned has made me a reliable and resourceful team-player with excellent time-management and pressure-handling skills Being someone who thrives and excels on challenges, I want to work collaboratively under the supervision of HR experts at Devsinc and gain insight into each facet of Human Resources. I hope that this learning opportunity enables me to add value by integrating the core HR practices within the company and help it grow by focusing on its “Human Assets”."
